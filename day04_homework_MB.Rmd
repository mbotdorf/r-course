1. Find some aspect of your data that needs to be combined or merged in some way.  This could be a variety of things:
  - multiple "sheets" in an Excel
  - multiple files that should be combined into one data set
  - properties that need to be merged in to one data set. For example:
    - you have a table of subject properties (gender, handedness, etc.) that need to be merged into the item-level data
    - you have other information on countries (population, etc.) that need to be merged in
  - if you DON'T have this naturally-occurring issue, figure out a way to manufacture it. For example:
    - split up your data into chunks
    - make up some new table of information that you want to merge in
  - Explain (in words) what you are trying to do
  - Use binding/merging commands to accomplish this

```{r}
library(dplyr)
survey.data<-read.csv("~/Documents/R course/survey.csv")
summary(survey.data)
survey.data.new<-na.omit(survey.data)
nrow(survey.data.new)
class(survey.data)
survey.female<-survey.data.new[survey.data.new$Sex=="Female", ]
survey.male<-survey.data.new[survey.data.new$Sex=="Male", ]
bind.survey<-bind_rows(survey.female,survey.male)
identical(survey.data.new, bind.survey)
summary(survey.data.new)
summary(bind.survey)
#I first tried to split the sex column in half with females in one half and males in the other. For some reason though, when I use bind_rows to bind them back together and then compare them using identical(), I find that they are not the same. When I compare the summary for each data frame, they look the same so I'm not sure what could be causing this. 

#I then tried to split the data in half columns and bind it back together using bind_cols, which I was able to do. 
survey.data.hand<-survey.data[,1:6]
survey.data.other<-survey.data[,7:13]
cbind.survey<-bind_cols(survey.data.hand,survey.data.other)
identical(survey.data,cbind.survey)
```
